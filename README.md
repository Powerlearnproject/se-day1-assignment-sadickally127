#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

a) Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering refers to the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development of high quality software systems.

b) Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Key milestones in the evolution of software engineering include:
i/Development of programming languages, example Fortran.
ii/Establishment of Software Engineering as a discipline/profession.
iii/ The prominence of the Internet, which led to the dominance of software engineering for web-based applications.
iv/ The rise of Agile methodologies which are valuable in software development.
v/ The intorduction of mobile devices (phones, smartphones, tablets) which have greatly contributed to the application of software engineering in the development of mobile apps.

c) List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
the following are the software development phases of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
i/ Requireents: Involves gathering requirements/needs of users and stakeholders of the given software development-project.
ii/ Design: Involves designing the structure/architecture or blueprint for the desired software solution by taking into consideration the gathered requirements of the stakeholders of the software development project.
iii/ Implementation: Involves actual development of the software solution by following the already designed blueprint of the software solution.
iv/ Testing: This phase involves testing different aspects of the developed software solution so as to assess its quality and conformity with the requirements of the stakeholders before being released into the usage-environment for the users.
v/ Deployment: This is where the developed software-solution is released in the usage-environment to be used by the users.
vi/ Maintenance: This is the last phase of SDLC which involves upgrading, fixing and troubleshooting different aspects of the already-deployed software solution, based on the feedback and reviews provided by the users of the given software solution.  

d) Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
i/ Waterfall methodologies: Refers to the collection of software development approaches which involve the development of software solutions in a sequential manner. Methodologies under this category work well for medium and small-scale software development projects which demand enough development schedules. Methodologies under this category are very thorough in terms of the development of the software solutions as they involve a sequential progress in the development, one cannot move to the next development phase without being thorough with the previous phase. 
      While
ii/ Agile/Iterative methodologies: Refers to the collection of software development approaches which involve the development of software solutions in an iterative manner. Methodologies under this category work well for all scales/scopes software development projects which have tight development schedules. Methodologies under this category involve creation of prototypes from which feedback and reviews from the users are used to develop improved versions for the given software solutions. 

e) Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
i/Roles of Software Developer:
- Designing and Implementing (coding) the software solutions.
- Trouleshooting different problems associated with the developed software solution.
- Providing technical support to users of the given software solutions.
- Collaborating with other individuals involved in the software development projects so as to develop software solutions which respond to the objectives/Goals of the given software development project.

ii/ Roles of Quality Assurance Engineer:
- Design, Plan and Implement the Quality tests on the developed software solutions.
- Track the improvements/corrections performed on the developed software solutions.
- Collaborating with other individuals involved in the software development projects so as to develop software solutions which respond to the objectives/Goals of the given software development project.

iii/ Roles of Project Manager:
- Overseeing and supervising the whole software development project.
- Organizing and coordinating teams and individuals involved in the software development project.
- Controlling the Budget and costs for the development of the given software solution.
- Assigning roles and responsibilities to teams and individuals involved in the software development project.
- Managing all resources utilized in the development of the given software solution.
- Collaborating with other individuals involved in the software development projects so as to develop software solutions which respond to the objectives/Goals of the given software development project.


f) Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
i/ the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) (Example: Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA):
- Productivity Boost: IDEs help to streamline the workflow by providing for writing, debugging, and testing the code within the same environment.
- Code Quality: They provide features like auto-formatting and linting which help to maintain consistent code style.
- Collaboration: They provide a standardized environment where team members can quickly adapt to the projectâ€™s setup and share different materials and aspects of the project during development.
- Error Detection: IDEs catch typos, missing imports, and other issues as one types the code in them.
- Efficient Learning Curve: IDEs consolidate features, so that one doesn't spend hours learning individual tools in the development of the Software/code solution.

ii/ the importance of  Version Control Systems (VCS) (Example: Git, Subversion, Mercurial):
- Team Collaboration: VCS enables seamless teamwork, even across different locations.
- Error Prevention: Real-time detection of mistakes.
- Disaster Recovery: They help in recovery situations due to the fact that they keep track of every change that is made in the software/code.
- Auditing and Accountability: They provide a simple way of keeping history of changes and initiators of the given changes, which are very crucial in Code-Auditing activites.
- Branching Strategies: VCS allows for feature branches, hotfixes, and release branches.


g) What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
i/ The following are some common challenges faced by software engineers:
- Changing Requirements.
- Tight deadlines.
- Technical debts.

ii/ The following are strategies to overcome these challenges:
- Effective collaboration among the collaborating/working teams which are working on the same project.
- The use of Agile methodologies in the development, which ensure faster and quality development of the software solutions.
- Prioritization of tasks.
- Regular assessment of Goals and Timelines.


h) Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
The following are the different types of Testing and their Importance in Software quality assurance:
i/ Unit testing: This refers to the type of testing which involves testing the individual code components like functions, methods, loops and others in isolation. Unit Testing is very helpful in ensuring that each building block works correctly before assembling the whole system.

ii/ Integration Testing: This refers to the type of testing which involves checking how different modules/blocks/components of the system work together. Integration Testing is important in exposing the existing defects in the Interactions and data flow among different components in the system.

iii/ System Testing: This refers to the type of testing which involves evaluating the entire software system as a whole. System testing is useful in evaluating end-to-end functionality and user scenarios.

iv/ Acceptance Testing: This refers to the type of testing whereby users of the given software/system validate if the developed software meets the business requirements. Acceptance testing is helpful in ensurin user satisfaction and alignment with the business goals/objectives for the development of the given software.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


a) Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering: Refers to the  art and science of crafting precise and contextually relevant instructions or prompts when interacting with AI models. The significance of prompt engineering in interacting with AI models include: Steering the AI responses to ensure that they meet the demands of the user and it helps to improve the user experience when interacting with the AI.


b) Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

- Example of a vague prompt: "Write a story".

- The Improved, clear, specific and concise prompt: "Craft a story about Impacts of Slavery, in the 1800s in America and Africa."

The Improved prompt is more effective because: 
- The prompt has been made specific, whereby it specifically instructs the AI to develop a story on a specific topic, in a specific context and time.
- The prompt has been made clear, where by it openly instructs the AI to perform a particaular specific act on the basis of particular specific factors/facts.
